# Algorithm-Visualizer

The Algorithm Visualizer project is an interactive tool designed to showcase various sorting algorithms and Operations of various data structures in action. Through an intuitive user interface,In sorting visualizer users can select a sorting algorithm of their choice, set the size of the array to be sorted, and witness the step-by-step process of sorting. As the algorithm progresses, the tool visually represents how elements are rearranged, providing a clear and engaging demonstration of each algorithm's behavior.

Key functions include:

Algorithm Selection: Users can choose from a range of sorting algorithms such as Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and more.

Array Generation: The tool generates random or customizable arrays of varying sizes, enabling users to observe how algorithms perform under different conditions.

Visualization: As the chosen algorithm runs, the tool visually animates each step of the sorting process, allowing users to see how elements are swapped and repositioned.

Speed Control: Users can adjust the speed of the animation, enabling them to slow down or speed up the sorting process for better comprehension.

Educational Insight: The Sorting Visualizer serves as an educational resource, helping users understand the fundamental principles behind sorting algorithms and their varying efficiency.

A comprehensive algorithm visualizer not only tackles sorting algorithms but extends its functionality to visualize the workings of linked lists, stacks, and queues, providing an encompassing educational tool. Users can witness the dynamic operations of linked lists, observing node manipulations and connections in real-time. Similarly, the visualizer brings the functionalities of stacks and queues to life, illustrating the push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue operations visually.

For linked lists, users can see nodes being added, removed, and rearranged, offering a clearer understanding of this fundamental data structure. In the case of stacks, the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle is visually demonstrated, showcasing how elements are added and removed from the top of the stack. Meanwhile, the FIFO (First In, First Out) behavior of queues is vividly illustrated, providing a visual representation of how elements enter and exit the queue.

This comprehensive approach allows learners to not only comprehend sorting algorithms but also gain insights into the fundamental concepts of linked lists, stacks, and queues through interactive and visually engaging experiences.
